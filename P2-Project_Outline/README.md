### Overview
Include overview here

My app will be a dog blog where users will be able to give reviews about certain breeds. The app will include information about the 
dogs breed, color,health issues, diet and overall rating. The Good Dog App will be helpful to families or people who have a difficult
time selecting dog. There will be a section in the app where users will be able to add additional information if they want to.
This app will help people narrow down their search for the right breed with reviews and pictures of different dogs. This idea came
from my experience with my dog Lacey. I got her last year but had no clue on the behavior of shelties. I went to different sights
but some of the material was hard to maneuver through; I just needed straigh answers and testimonies about the breed. Users will find
this app useful because of how easy it would be to simply type in a name of a breed give a review or go over a review without
going through pages of useless information.
